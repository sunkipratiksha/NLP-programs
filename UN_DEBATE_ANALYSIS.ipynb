              "'Let me first congratulate you, Mr.\\nPresident, on your election as President of the General\\nAssembly for its forty-ninth session. The American people\\nlook forward to working with you to celebrate the United\\nNations fiftieth anniversary.\\nWe meet today at a time of great hope and change.\\nThe end of the cold war, the explosion of technology and\\ntrade and enterprise have given people the world over new\\nopportunities to live up to their dreams and their God-given\\npotential. This is an age of hope -yet in this new world,\\nwe face a contest as old as history.\\nIt is a struggle between freedom and tyranny; between\\ntolerance and bigotry; between knowledge and ignorance;\\nbetween openness and isolation. It is a fight between those\\nwho would build free societies governed by laws and\\nthose who would impose their will by force.\\nOur struggle today - in a world more high-tech,\\nmore fast-moving, more chaotically diverse than ever - is\\nthe age-old fight between hope and fear.\\nThree times in this century - from the trenches of the\\nSomme to the island of Iwo Jima to the shattered Wall in\\nBerlin - the forces of hope were victorious. But the\\nvictors of the First World War squandered their triumph\\nwhen they turned inward, bringing on a global depression,\\nand allowing fascism to rise and reignite global war.\\nAfter the Second World War, the Allies learned the\\nlesson of the past. In the face of a new totalitarian threat\\nand the nuclear menace, great nations did not walk away\\nfrom the challenge of the moment. Instead they chose to\\nreach out, to rebuild and to lead. They chose to create the\\nUnited Nations and they left us a world stronger, safer\\nand freer.\\nOur generation has a difficult task: the cold war is\\nover. We must secure the peace. It falls to us to avoid\\nthe complacency that followed the First World War -\\nwithout the spur of the imminent threat to our security\\nthat followed the Second World War.\\nWe must ensure that those who fought and found the\\ncourage to end the cold war - those from both East and\\nWest who loved freedom - did not labour in vain. Our\\nsacred mission is to build a new world for our children -\\nmore democratic, more prosperous, more free of ancient\\nhatreds and modern means of destruction.\\nThat is no easy challenge; but we accept it with\\nconfidence. After all, the walls that once divided nations\\nin this very Hall have come down. More nations have\\nchosen democracy than ever before. More have chosen\\nfree markets and economic justice. More have embraced\\nthe values of tolerance and liberty and civil society that\\nallow us all to make the most of our lives.\\nBut while the ideals of democracy and free markets\\nare ascendant, they are surely not the whole story.\\nTerrible examples of chaos, repression and tyranny also\\nmark our times. The twentieth century has proved that\\nthe forces of freedom and democracy can endure against\\ngreat odds; our job is to see that in the twenty-first\\ncentury these forces triumph.\\n6\\n\\n\\nThe dangers we face are less stark and more diffuse\\nthan those of the cold war, but they are still formidable:\\nthe ethnic conflicts that drive millions from their homes;\\nthe despots ready to repress their own people or conquer\\ntheir neighbours; the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction; the terrorists wielding their deadly arms; the\\ncriminal syndicates selling those arms, or drugs, infiltrating\\nthe very institutions of fragile democracies; a global\\neconomy that offers great promise but also deep insecurity,\\nand in many places declining opportunity; diseases like\\nAIDS that threaten to decimate nations; the combined\\ndangers of population explosion and economic decline,\\nwhich prompted the world community to reach the\\nremarkable consensus at the Cairo Conference; global and\\nlocal environmental threats that demand that sustainable\\ndevelopment become a part of the lives of people all\\naround the world; and, finally, within many of our nations,\\nhigh rates of drug abuse and crime and family breakdown,\\nwith all their terrible consequences. These are the dangers\\nwe face today.\\nWe must address these threats to our future.\\nThankfully, the end of the cold war gives us a chance to\\naddress them together. In our efforts, different nations may\\nbe active in different situations in different ways, but their\\npurposes must be consistent with freedom and their\\npractices consistent with international law. Each nation will\\nbring to our common task its own particular strengths -\\neconomic, political or military.\\nOf course, the first duty of every Member of the\\nUnited Nations is to its own citizens, to their security, their\\nwelfare and their interests. As President of the United\\nStates, my first duty is to the citizens of my country.\\nWhen our national security interests are threatened, we will\\nact with others when we can, but alone if we must. We\\nwill use diplomacy when we can, but force if we must.\\nThe United States recognizes that we also have a\\nspecial responsibility in these common endeavours that we\\nare undertaking, the responsibility that goes along with\\ngreat power and also with our long history of democracy\\nand freedom. But we seek to fulfil that responsibility in\\ncooperation with other nations. Working together increases\\nthe impact and the legitimacy of each of our actions, and\\nsharing the burdens lessens everyone’s load. We have no\\ndesire to be the world’s policeman, but we will do what we\\ncan to help civil societies emerge from the ashes of\\nrepression, to sustain fragile democracies, to add more free\\nmarkets to the world, and of course to restrain the\\ndestructive forces that threaten us all.\\nIn every corner of the globe, from South Africa to\\nAsia, to Central and Eastern Europe, to the Middle East\\nand Latin America, and now to a small island in the\\nCaribbean, ordinary citizens are striving to build their\\nown future. Promoting their cause is our generation’s\\ngreat opportunity, and we must do it together. A\\ncoalition for democracy is good for America.\\nDemocracies, after all, are more likely to be stable, less\\nlikely to wage war; they strengthen civil society and can\\nprovide people with the economic and political\\nopportunities to build their futures in their own homes -\\nnot to flee their borders.\\nOur efforts to help build more democracies will\\nmake us all more secure, more prosperous and more\\nsuccessful as we try to make this era of terrific change\\nour friend, and not our enemy. In my nation, as in all of\\nyour nations, there are many people who are\\nunderstandably reluctant to undertake these efforts\\nbecause often the distances are great or the cultures are\\ndifferent. There are good reasons for the caution that\\npeople feel. Often, the chances of success or its costs are\\nunclear. And, of course, in every common endeavour\\nthere is always the potential for failure and often the risk\\nof loss of life.\\nAnd yet our people - as we have seen in the\\nremarkable global response to the terrible crisis in\\nRwanda - genuinely want to help their neighbours around\\nthe world and to make some effort in our common cause.\\nWe have seen that progress can be made as well. The\\nproblem is deciding when we must respond and how we\\nshall overcome our reluctance. This will never be easy.\\nThere are no simple formulas. All of us will make these\\ndecisions in part based on the distance of the problem\\nfrom our shores, the interests of our nation, the difference\\nwe think we can make, the costs required, or the threat to\\nour own citizens in the endeavour.\\nHard questions will remain, and cannot be erased by\\nsome simple formula. But we should have the confidence\\nthat these efforts can succeed, whether they are efforts to\\nkeep people alive in the face of terrible tragedy, as in\\nRwanda, or our efforts to avert a tragedy, as in the Horn\\nof Africa, or our efforts to support processes that are\\nliterally changing the future of millions. History is on\\nour side. We should have confidence about this. Look\\nat the march of freedom we have seen in the last year\\nalone. Who, a decade ago, would have dared predict the\\nstartling changes in South Africa, in the Middle East and\\nin Ireland; the stunning triumph of democracy and\\nmajority rule and the redemption of the purpose of Nelson\\n7\\n\\n\\nMandela’s life; the brave efforts of Israel and its Arab\\nneighbours to build bridges of peace between their peoples;\\nthe earnest search by the people of Northern Ireland and\\nGreat Britain and Ireland to end centuries of division and\\ndecades of terror? In each case, credit belongs to those\\nnations’ leaders and their courageous people. But in each\\ninstance the United States and other nations were privileged\\nto help in these causes.\\nThe growth of cooperation between the United States\\nand the Russian Federation also should give us all great\\ncause for confidence. This is a partnership that is rooted in\\ndemocracy, a partnership that is working, a partnership of,\\nnot complete agreement, but genuine mutual respect. After\\nso many years of nuclear terror, our two nations are taking\\ndramatic steps to ease tensions around the world. For the\\nfirst time since the Second World War, foreign troops do\\nnot occupy the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. The\\nBaltic nations are free. Russian and American missiles no\\nlonger target each other’s people. Three of the four nuclear\\nmembers of the former Soviet Union have agreed to\\nremove all nuclear weapons from their soil. And we are\\nworking on agreements to halt production of fissile\\nmaterials for nuclear explosives; to make dismantling of\\nnuclear warheads transparent and irreversible; and further\\nto reduce our nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles.\\nThe United States and Russia also recognize that we\\nmust cooperate to control the emerging danger of terrorists\\nwho traffic in nuclear materials. To secure nuclear\\nmaterials at their sources, we have agreed with Russia to\\nstop plutonium production by the year 2000; to construct a\\nstorage facility for fissile materials and buy up stocks of\\nweapons-grade fuel; and to combat the criminals who are\\ntrying to smuggle materials for nuclear explosives. Our\\ntwo nations and Germany have increased cooperation and\\nengaged in joint anti-terrorist training. Soon, under the\\nleadership of our Federal Bureau of Investigation, we will\\nopen a law enforcement training academy in Europe, where\\npolice will learn how to combat more effectively trafficking\\nof nuclear weapons components, as well as the drug trade,\\norganized crime and money laundering.\\nThe United States will also advance a wide-ranging\\nnon-proliferation agenda: a global convention to halt\\nproduction of fissile materials; efforts to curb North\\nKorea’s nuclear ambitions; transparent procedures for\\ndismantling nuclear warheads; and our work to ban testing\\nand to extend the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\\nNuclear Weapons. And today I am proposing a first step\\ntoward the eventual elimination of a less visible but still\\ndeadly threat: the world’s 85 million anti-personnel land-\\nmines - one for every 50 persons on the face of the earth.\\nI ask all nations concerned to join with us and conclude\\nan agreement to reduce the number and availability of\\nthose mines. Ridding the world of those often hidden\\nweapons will help to save the lives of tens of thousands\\nof men, women and innocent children in the years to\\ncome.\\nOur progress in the last year also provides\\nconfidence that in the post-cold-war years we can adapt\\nand construct global institutions that will help to provide\\nsecurity and increase economic growth throughout the\\nworld. Since I spoke here last year, 22 nations have\\njoined the Partnership for Peace of the North Atlantic\\nTreaty Organization (NATO). The first joint exercises\\nhave been conducted, helping to give Europe the chance\\nto become a more unified continent in which democratic\\nnations live within secure borders. In Asia, security talks\\nand economic cooperation will lead to further stability.\\nBy reducing nations’ fears about their borders and\\nallowing them to spend less on military defences, our\\ncoalition for democracy can give nations in transition a\\nbetter chance to offer new freedoms and opportunities to\\ntheir own people. It is time that we think anew about the\\nstructures of this global economy as well, tearing down\\nwalls that separate nations instead of hiding behind them.\\nAt the Group of Seven meeting at Naples this year\\nwe committed ourselves to this task of renewal, to re-\\nexamining the economic institutions that have served us\\nso well in the past. In the interests of shared prosperity,\\nthe United States actively promotes open markets.\\nThough still in its infancy, the North American Free\\nTrade Agreement has dramatically increased trade\\nbetween the United States and Mexico and has produced\\nin the United States alone an estimated 200,000 new jobs.\\nIt offers a model to nations throughout the Americas\\nwhich we hope to build on. And this week I will send\\nlegislation to the Congress to implement the General\\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the largest\\ntrade agreement in all of history. GATT - and its\\nsuccessor, the World Trade Organization - holds the\\npromise for all of us of increased exports, higher wages\\nand improved living standards. In the months and years\\nto come we will work no less to extend the reach of open\\nmarkets, starting with the Asia-Pacific Economic\\nCooperation Council and the Summit of the Americas\\nlater this year.\\nHere at the United Nations we must develop a\\nconcrete plan to meet the challenges of the next 50 years\\neven as we celebrate the last 50 years. I believe we\\n8\\n\\n\\nshould declare next year’s fiftieth anniversary not just a\\nyear of celebration but a year of renewal. We call on the\\nSecretary-General to name a working group so that by the\\ntime we meet next year we will have a concrete action plan\\nto revitalize the obligations of the United Nations to address\\nthe security, economic and political challenges ahead -\\nobligations we must all be willing to assume.\\nOur objectives should include ready, efficient and\\ncapable United Nations peace-keeping forces, and I am\\nhappy to report that, as I pledged last year and thanks to\\nsupport in the United States Congress, $1.2 billion is now\\navailable from the United States for this critical account.\\nWe must also pledge to keep United Nations reform\\nmoving forward so that we do more with less, and we must\\nimprove our ability to respond to urgent needs. Let me\\nsuggest that it is time for the members of the Assembly to\\nconsider seriously President Menem’s suggestion for the\\ncreation of a civilian rapid-response capability for\\nhumanitarian crises.\\nAnd let us not lose sight of the special role that\\ndevelopment and democracy can play in preventing\\nconflicts once peace has been established. Never before\\nhas the United Nations been in a better position to achieve\\nthe democratic goals of our founders. The end of the cold\\nwar has freed us from decades of paralysing divisions. And\\nwe all know that multilateral cooperation is not only\\nnecessary to address the new threats we face but possible\\nto succeed.\\nThe efforts we have undertaken together in Haiti are\\na prime example. Under the sponsorship of the United\\nNations, American troops, now being joined by the\\npersonnel of an ever-growing international coalition of over\\ntwo dozen nations, are giving the people of Haiti their\\nchance at freedom. Creative diplomacy, the influence of\\neconomic power and the credible threat of military force -\\nall have contributed to this moment of opportunity.\\nEssential civil order will be restored. Human rights\\nviolations will be curbed. The first refugees will be\\nreturning within hours, on this day. The military leaders\\nwill step down. The democratic Government will be\\nrestored. President Aristide will return. The multinational\\nmission will turn its responsibilities over to the United\\nNations mission, which will remain in Haiti throughout\\n1995, until a new president is elected. During this time a\\nmultinational development effort will make available more\\nthan $1 billion to begin helping the Haitians rebuild their\\ncountry. In the spirit of reconciliation and reconstruction,\\nPresident Aristide yesterday called for the immediate easing\\nof sanctions so that the work of rebuilding can begin\\nimmediately. Accordingly, I intend to act expeditiously,\\nwithin Security Council resolutions 917 (1994) and 940\\n(1994) to enable us to restore health care, water and\\nelectrical services, construction materials for humanitarian\\nefforts, and communications, agricultural and educational\\nmaterials.\\nToday I am also announcing that the United States\\nwill suspend all unilateral sanctions against Haiti except\\nthose that affect the military leaders and their immediate\\nsupporters. This will include regularly scheduled air\\nflights when the airport becomes available, financial\\ntransactions and travel restrictions. I urge all other\\nnations to do the same.\\nIn Haiti, the United States has demonstrated that it\\nwould lead a multinational force when our interests are\\nplain, when the cause is right, when the mission is\\nachievable and the nations of the world stand with us.\\nBut Haiti’s people will have to muster the strength and\\nthe patience to travel the road of freedom. They have to\\ndo this for themselves. Every new democratic nation is\\nfragile. But we will see the day when the people of Haiti\\nfulfil their aspirations to liberty and when they are once\\nagain making genuine economic progress.\\nUnited Nations actions in Bosnia, like those in Haiti,\\ndemonstrate that progress can be made when a coalition\\nbacks up diplomacy with military power. For the first\\ntime ever, NATO has taken, since we met last year,\\nmilitary actions beyond the territory of its members. The\\nthreat of NATO air power helped to establish the\\nexclusion zone around Sarajevo and to end the Bosnian\\nSerbs’ spring offensive against Gorazde. NATO’s\\nFebruary ultimatum boosted our mediation efforts, which\\nhelped to end the war between the Bosnian Government\\nand the Bosnian Croats and forged a federation between\\nthose two communities. To that extent the situation in\\nBosnia has improved, but in recent weeks the situation\\naround Sarajevo has deteriorated substantially, and\\nSarajevo once again faces the prospect of strangulation.\\nA new resolve by the United Nations to enforce its\\nresolutions is now necessary to save Sarajevo, and NATO\\nstands ready to act.\\nThe situation in Bosnia is yet another reminder of\\nthe greatest irony of this century we are leaving. This\\ncentury, so full of hope and opportunity and achievement,\\nhas also been an age of deep destruction and despair. We\\ncannot help but remember the millions who gave their\\nlives during two world wars and the half century of\\n9\\n\\n\\nstruggle by men and women in the East and West who\\nultimately prevailed in the name of freedom.\\nBut we must also think of our children and the world\\nwe will leave them in the twenty-first century. History has\\ngiven us a very rare opportunity - the chance to build on\\nthe greatest legacy of this century without reliving its\\ndarkest moments. And we have shown that we can carry\\nforward humanity’s ancient quest for freedom to build a\\nworld where democracy knows no borders but where\\nnations know their borders will always be secure, a world\\nthat gives all people the chance to realize their potential and\\nto live out their dreams.\\n'"
